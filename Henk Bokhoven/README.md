# Basic tooling voor Docker  
By Henk Bokhoven

## Presentation
My presentation can be found on Speakerdeck: [Basic tooling voor Docker](https://speakerdeck.com/hbokh/docker-grunn-basic-tooling-voor-docker)

## Fig and Crane
See examples included in this folder.

## Docker aliases
See .profile-example for the mentioned aliases on slide 7.

## Buckets CMS
A reference to Buckets CMS in Docker was made in the first Fig & Crane-slide (slide 10).  
You can find the specific repository [here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/hbokh/docker-buckets-cms/)

## Dockerfile example
have a look at the RUN and COPY blocks.

## My JIRA sample  
Off topic, but I also "fiddled about" with JIRA and Docker.  
The results can be found on Docker Hub: [JIRA testcase](https://hub.docker.com/u/hbokh/docker-jira-postgresql/)

Cheers, Henk
